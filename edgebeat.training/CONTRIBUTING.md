# Contributing to EdgeBeat

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **EdgeBeat**! EdgeBeat is an open-source project driven by its community, and we welcome contributions of all kinds. This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for contributors, ensuring that our collaborative efforts align with EdgeBeat‚Äôs open-source governance model and maintain the project‚Äôs quality and inclusive culture.

## Types of Contributions

EdgeBeat values many types of contributions ‚Äì not just code. In fact, code is often only part of what makes a project successful, and other contributions are equally important ([How to Contribute to Open Source | Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#:~:text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20contribute,code))  Here are the main ways you can contribute:

- **Code:** Implement new features, fix bugs, improve performance, or refactor code. This also includes writing unit tests to catch issues and ensure new code works properly.
- **Documentation:** Improve our documentation, such as fixing typos, clarifying usage examples, adding tutorials, or expanding explanation of features. Good documentation is critical and often the most overlooked contribution ([How to Contribute to Open Source | Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#:~:text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20contribute,code)) 
- **Issue Reporting (Bug Reports):** If you find a bug, report it by opening an issue. Provide details and steps to reproduce (see guidelines below). High-quality bug reports help us identify problems quickly.
- **Feature Requests:** Suggest new features or enhancements. Explain what you‚Äôd like to see and how it would benefit users (with examples or use-cases). Even if you can‚Äôt implement it yourself, a well-described idea can spark community discussion.
- **Community Engagement:** Participate in discussions, answer questions, and help other users. You can contribute by responding to issues, helping troubleshoot, writing how-to guides, or improving the project‚Äôs visibility (e.g. writing blog posts or tutorials about EdgeBeat). Fostering a friendly, helpful community is a valuable contribution in itself.

*(If you‚Äôre new to open source, remember: you don‚Äôt have to contribute only code ‚Äì testing, feedback, documentation, and community support are all valuable contributions! ([How to Contribute to Open Source | Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#:~:text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20contribute,code)) *

## How to Contribute

Below is a step-by-step guide for contributing to EdgeBeat. Following these steps helps maintain a smooth workflow:

1. **Fork the repository:** Start by forking the EdgeBeat repository to your own GitHub account. This creates your personal copy where you can make changes. (Avoid working on the official EdgeBeat repository directly) ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=Please%20always%20fork%20the%20Acts,it%20can%20be%20merged%20in)) 
2. **Clone your fork:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory. This will set up the code on your development environment.
3. **Set up the development environment:** Install any dependencies or tools needed to build and test EdgeBeat. Instructions for this are usually in the `README.md` or a dedicated setup guide. For example, you might need to run commands like `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` depending on the technology. Ensure you can run the project and tests locally.
4. **Create a new branch:** Before making changes, create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the purpose of your changes, such as `feature/add-user-login` or `bugfix/fix-memory-leak`. Make sure your branch is based on the latest `main` branch. (Each contribution or fix should have its own branch ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=1,branch%20of%20your%20private%20fork))  and avoid working on the `main` branch directly ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=2,on%20any%20%E2%80%9Cofficial%E2%80%9D%20branch)) )
5. **Make your changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix on your branch. Follow our coding standards (see below) when writing code. If you are adding a new feature or fixing a bug, try to include or update unit tests to cover your changes.
6. **Run tests and linters:** Before committing, run the test suite and any linters or formatters provided by the project (for example, run `npm test`, `pytest`, or other commands as applicable). This ensures your changes don‚Äôt break existing functionality and conform to code style. All tests should pass locally, and code should meet our linting rules.
7. **Commit your changes:** Commit your work in logical chunks with clear commit messages. A good commit message briefly summarizes *what* change you made and *why* (e.g., ‚ÄúFix crash when loading config without network ‚Äì resolves #123‚Äù). Avoid large, monolithic commits; instead, break your work into coherent commits. If you accidentally make too many small commits or messy commits, you can squash or clean them up before submitting the PR.
8. **Push to your fork:** Push your feature branch to your fork on GitHub.
9. **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the EdgeBeat repository and open a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch. Provide a clear **description** of your changes in the PR template: explain *what* your change does and *why* it‚Äôs needed. If the PR fixes an open issue, mention ‚ÄúCloses #issuenumber‚Äù in the description. Choose the appropriate target branch (usually `main` unless otherwise instructed).
10. **Mark draft or request review:** If your PR is not yet ready for full review (for example, if it‚Äôs a work in progress), mark it as a ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù Pull Request. Otherwise, request a review from project maintainers or specific reviewers. It's often helpful to @-mention a maintainer for visibility once your PR is ready for review ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=,it%20can%20be%20merged%20in)) 
11. **Discuss and iterate:** A maintainer will review your PR (see **Review and Approval Process** below). They may suggest changes or ask questions. Engage in the conversation: clarify any points and make additional commits to address feedback. Push updates to the same branch; your PR will automatically update.
12. **Keep your branch up-to-date:** If other changes are merged into `main` while your PR is open, update your branch by merging the latest `main` into your branch or rebasing your branch on top of the new `main`. This prevents merge conflicts and makes it easier to integrate your changes. If a PR remains open for a while, rebasing on the latest `main` ensures a smoother merge ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=,to%20ensure%20a%20speedier%20resolution)) 
13. **Final review and merge:** Once your contribution meets the project‚Äôs requirements and gets approval from maintainers, it will be merged into the codebase (usually by a maintainer). You‚Äôll get a notification when it‚Äôs merged. üéâ Feel proud ‚Äì you just contributed to EdgeBeat! Maintainers may squash commits or rebase as needed during merge to keep the project history clean.
14. **Post-merge cleanup:** It‚Äôs usually safe to delete your feature branch after the PR is merged (GitHub may do this automatically if you enable the option). If you plan further work, you can keep the branch, but generally starting a fresh branch for each contribution is recommended.

If you‚Äôre unsure about anything at any step, feel free to ask questions by opening a discussion or reaching out to the maintainers. We‚Äôre here to help you succeed in contributing.

## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality and consistency across the project, all contributions must follow EdgeBeat‚Äôs coding standards and best practices. This ensures that the codebase remains readable, reliable, and easy to maintain. Here are the key guidelines:

- **Follow the project‚Äôs style:** Adopt the existing coding style and conventions you see in the repository. Consistency with the current codebase is more important than personal preferenc ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=,just%20follow%20along)) . For example, if EdgeBeat is written in Python, follow the PEP 8 style guide (which is commonly used in Python project ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=,on%20the%20lead%20maintainers%E2%80%99%20preferences)) ) unless the project has its own style deviations. If it‚Äôs a JavaScript project, adhere to its established formatting (you might find an ESLint config or Prettier setup in the repo).
- **Use formatting and linting tools:** We use automated linters/formatters to catch style issues and common errors. Linting enforces guidelines for naming, formatting, and readabilit ([Code Styling and Linting ‚Äî The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/code-styling.html#:~:text=Overview)) . Before submitting, ensure your code passes all linting checks (run the linter locally if available). This includes using consistent indentation, spacing, and naming conventions. Clean, linted code makes reviews go much faster.
- **Document your code and changes:** Update documentation as part of your contribution. This means:
  - Adding or updating **docstrings/comments** for public functions, classes, or complex code segments so that others understand the purpose and usage of your cod ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=Documentation%20isn%E2%80%99t%20optional%C2%B6)) .
  - If you add a new feature or change an existing behavior, update any relevant **user documentation** (e.g., Markdown files in the repo‚Äôs docs folder or the README) to reflect the change. Documenting your contribution is not optional ‚Äì maintainers may ask you to add docs if they‚Äôre missin ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=Documentation%20isn%E2%80%99t%20optional%C2%B6)) .
  - Include any necessary usage examples or upgrade notes if your change might affect existing users.
- **Write tests for your changes:** Wherever feasible, include **unit tests or integration tests** for new features and bug fixe ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=Tests%20aren%E2%80%99t%20optional%C2%B6)) . If fixing a bug, try to write a test that fails before your fix and passes after ‚Äì this prevents regressions. If adding a feature, add tests that cover the new functionality. Pull requests that add code without appropriate tests may require additional justification and could be delayed. (Certain small changes like fixing a typo in documentation might not need tests, of course.)
- **Ensure all tests pass:** Before you push your changes, run the full test suite. Your contribution should not break any existing tests. If you do encounter failing tests unrelated to your change, you can ask for guidance ‚Äì but generally, a PR is expected to be green on all tests and checks before review.
- **Code quality and best practices:** Write code that is clear and maintainable. Avoid introducing new warnings or errors. Use meaningful variable and function names. Handle errors and edge cases gracefully. Keep functions and classes focused on a single responsibility when possible. If you‚Äôre working in a language that has a style guide or best practices document (like Python‚Äôs PEP 8 or Go‚Äôs Effective Go), follow those guidelines as they likely apply to our project as well.
- **Performance and dependencies:** Be mindful of the performance impact of your changes. If you introduce a new dependency, ensure it‚Äôs necessary and discuss it in the PR (adding dependencies may require maintainer approval).
- **Consistent formatting:** If the project provides a configuration for a formatter (like Prettier, Black, gofmt, etc.), use it before committing. This automatically formats your code to the project standard. Some projects have a commit hook or CI check that will reject improperly formatted code.
- **Preview your changes:** Especially for documentation contributions, it can be helpful to build the docs or preview the Markdown to ensure formatting is correct. For UI changes (if EdgeBeat has a UI component), test visually if possible.
- **Ask for help if needed:** If you‚Äôre unsure about the style or standards to follow, feel free to open an issue or discussion to ask. It‚Äôs better to get clarification than to guess and have to revise your code later.

By following these standards, you help us maintain a high-quality codebase and make it easier for maintainers to review and accept your contributions. Consistent and well-documented code benefits everyone!

## Issue Reporting and Feature Requests

We use GitHub (or our project‚Äôs issue tracker) to track bugs and feature ideas. If you want to report a problem or suggest a new feature, please follow these guidelines to ensure your submission is clear and helpful.

### Bug Reports (Issue Reporting)

If you encounter a bug in EdgeBeat, we want to know about it! Filing a detailed bug report helps us reproduce the issue and fix it faster. Please do the following:

- **Search for existing issues:** Before opening a new bug report, **check the existing issues** (open *and* closed) to see if the problem has already been reported or even fixed. Someone might have already noticed the issue. If you find an open issue that seems to describe your problem, you can add any additional details there (and üëç upvote it). If an issue is closed but you think it still persists in the latest version, you can comment to let us know. *Avoid filing duplicate reports* ‚Äì it saves everyone ti ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=,it%E2%80%99s%20not%20a%20known%20issue)) „Äë.
- **Update to latest version:** Make sure you are using the latest release of EdgeBeat. The bug might have been resolved in a newer version. If not, also try to see if the bug happens in the main branch or upcoming version (if you can test it). If it‚Äôs already fixed there, the fix will be in the next release.
- **Prepare a thorough report:** When you open a new issue for a bug, include **as much detail as possible**. At minimum, try to provide:
  - **Environment details:** e.g. your operating system (and version), relevant software versions (EdgeBeat version, Python/Node/Go version if applicable, etc.), and any configuration that might be relevant.
  - **Steps to reproduce:** A step-by-step description of how to trigger the bug. Include any special setup, data, or conditions needed. If you can provide a small code snippet or example that reliably reproduces the issue, that is extremely helpful.
  - **Expected behavior vs. Actual behavior:** What *should* happen, and what *did* happen. Describe the output or outcome you expected and how the actual result differed.
  - **Relevant logs or screenshots:** If the bug involves error messages, include the **full** error output or logs. For visual issues, screenshots or screencasts can help illustrate the problem.
  - **Additional context:** Any other details that might be relevant, such as network conditions, frequency of occurrence (e.g., ‚Äúhappens every time‚Äù vs ‚Äúintermittent‚Äù), or links to related issues.
  
  The goal is to help us recreate the issue on our end. Bug reports with insufficient information may not get addressed promptly because maintainers might not be able to reproduce th ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=What%20to%20put%20in%20your,bug%20report%C2%B6)) „Äë. Detailed reports, on the other hand, tend to get more attention and quicker fix ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=What%20to%20put%20in%20your,bug%20report%C2%B6)) „Äë.
- **Use the issue templates:** If our repository has issue templates (you‚Äôll see them when you click ‚ÄúNew Issue‚Äù), please fill them out. They are designed to remind you to include critical information. Provide a clear, descriptive title for the issue (e.g., ‚ÄúCrash when loading config with empty field‚Äù is better than ‚ÄúBug in app‚Äù).
- **Be polite and patient:** Remember, contributors and maintainers will look into the issue as time permits. You can always politely ask for updates if significant time has passed, but avoid spamming or harassing for a fix.
- **Follow up:** If you discover more information or a workaround after posting the issue, add a comment with those details. If the issue gets resolved (either by a fix or some other way), feel free to close it or comment on how you solved it. This can help others in the community.

### Feature Requests (Enhancements)

If you have an idea to improve EdgeBeat or add a new feature, we‚Äôd love to hear it. To propose a new feature or enhancement, please:

- **Check for prior suggestions:** Search the issue tracker (and discussion forums, if any) to see if someone else has already proposed something similar. If so, you can join that discussion and add your thoughts or support. This helps avoid duplicates and consolidates feedback.
- **Explain the problem and solution:** In a new feature request issue, clearly **describe the feature** or enhancement you‚Äôre proposing. Focus on the **problem it solves or the use case** it enables. For example, rather than saying ‚ÄúAdd X option,‚Äù explain what you‚Äôre trying to achieve and why the current functionality is insufficient. This context helps maintainers and contributors understand why the feature is needed.
- **Provide details and use cases:** The more details, the better. Describe how the feature should work from a user‚Äôs perspective, and give **specific use cases or scenarios** where you would use it. What benefits will this feature bring? How will it help others? A detailed feature request with real use-case examples and rationale is more likely to be well-receiv ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=)) „Äë. If applicable, you can suggest a basic implementation approach or alternatives you‚Äôve considered.
- **Label and categorize:** If the project uses labels like ‚Äúfeature‚Äù or ‚Äúenhancement,‚Äù tag your issue accordingly (or the maintainers will do so). A clear title like ‚ÄúFeature Request: Add support for X in the API‚Äù helps others understand the request at a glance.
- **Be open to discussion:** New features often require discussion. Maintainers or other community members might have questions, alternate suggestions, or concerns (e.g., scope, complexity, compatibility with the project‚Äôs vision). Engage constructively: answer questions, clarify your idea, and be open to feedback. Sometimes a different solution might better address the underlying problem you outlined.
- **Understand prioritization:** Not every feature request can be implemented, at least not right away. The maintainers will consider the alignment with project goals, complexity of implementation, and impact on users. If your feature isn‚Äôt taken up immediately, it may be added to a roadmap or backlog for future consideration. Don‚Äôt be discouraged ‚Äì even declined proposals are valuable, as they help define the project's direction and often lead to improvements in other ways.

By following these guidelines for issues and enhancements, you help us address your reports more effectively. Clear, well-structured bug reports and feature requests facilitate better discussions and faster resolutions.

## Review and Approval Process

All code contributions to EdgeBeat (via Pull Requests) go through a **code review** process. This is not only to maintain quality and stability, but also to share knowledge and mentor contributors. Here‚Äôs how the review and approval process works and what to expect:

- **Automated checks (CI) first:** When you submit a Pull Request, our Continuous Integration (CI) system will automatically run tests and linters on your changes. We recommend ensuring your PR is green (all checks passed) before requesting a review. Maintainers typically will not begin a review until the automated checks pass, since failing tests or linting errors need to be resolved fir ([Maintainers Code Review Guideline ¬∑ thorvg/thorvg Wiki ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/thorvg/thorvg/wiki/Maintainers-Code-Review-Guideline#:~:text=1,CI%20automated%20tests%20have%20passed)) „Äë. If CI finds issues, push follow-up commits to fix them.
- **Code review by maintainers:** Once your PR passes CI, it will be reviewed by one or more EdgeBeat maintainers (or sometimes experienced community reviewers). The reviewers will look at various aspects:
  - **Correctness:** Does the code do what it‚Äôs supposed to do? Does it handle edge cases?
  - **Code quality and style:** Is the code written following our coding standards and style guidelines? (Reviews help ensure all contributions adhere to the same standar ([What is a code review? | GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review/#:~:text=,the%20code%20before%20pushing%20changes)) „Äë.)
  - **Tests and docs:** Are there appropriate tests for the changes, and are documentation updates included if needed? A maintainer might check that you updated docs for a new feature or that a bug fix has an accompanying test.
  - **Design and architecture:** Is the solution efficient and in line with the project‚Äôs design principles? Perhaps there is a simpler or more general solution to the problem.
  - **Impact:** Does the change have any potential negative impact (performance, security, backward compatibility)? If so, are those addressed or acceptable?
  
  Code reviews are meant to improve the project and help contributors learn. They‚Äôre a collaborative dialogue ‚Äì don‚Äôt be alarmed by feedback or numerous comments. Even experienced developers get detailed reviews; it‚Äôs all part of building great software together. As an open-source project, we emphasize constructive feedback to maintain stability and guide contributo ([Maintainers Code Review Guideline ¬∑ thorvg/thorvg Wiki ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/thorvg/thorvg/wiki/Maintainers-Code-Review-Guideline#:~:text=Code%20reviews%20are%20highly%20encouraged,code%20reviews%20are%20as%20follows)) „Äë.
- **Maintainership and governance:** EdgeBeat‚Äôs open-source governance model means that final approval lies with the project maintainers or core team. Maintainers are responsible for ensuring that contributions align with the project‚Äôs needs and quality standards. They will review your PR and request changes if necessary. In some cases, a maintainer might invite other experts to review if the PR touches a specific area. All reviews are conducted respectfully and with appreciation for your effort.
- **Responding to feedback:** You might receive comments asking for revisions ‚Äì for example, to adjust some code, add a test, or clarify something. When this happens, make the necessary changes in your branch and push them; the PR will update automatically. It‚Äôs helpful to reply to review comments, either with a short note explaining how you resolved it, or with further questions if you need clarification. If you disagree with a suggestion, you can politely discuss it; explain your reasoning, or ask why the reviewer recommends a different approach. Remember, the goal is to reach the best outcome for the project.
- **What maintainers expect:** To get your contribution approved, ensure that:
  - Your PR is focused and does what it says (unrelated changes make review harder).
  - The description is clear about the *what* and *why* of the chan ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=,forward%20merge)) „Äë.
  - Relevant issue(s) are referenced (if it fixes or relates to an issu ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=,the%20pull%20request%20is%20provided)) „Äë.
  - You have added **tests** for new features or bug fixes, and they are passi ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=,been%20documented%20properly%20with%20doxygen)) „Äë.
  - You have updated **documentation** for any user-facing chang ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=,been%20documented%20properly%20with%20doxygen)) „Äë.
  - The code follows our style and passes linting/CI checks.
  
  Maintainers will specifically check for tests and documentation in the review. Patches that lack either may be held off until those are added, as part of maintaining project quality. Having a well-prepared PR (with tests, docs, and a good description) makes the review process much smooth ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=,forward%20merge))  ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=,been%20documented%20properly%20with%20doxygen)) „Äë.
- **Approval and merging:** After addressing any review comments, wait for the maintainers to give approval. Typically, at least one maintainer (often two for significant changes) needs to approve the PR before it can be merged. Once approved, a maintainer will merge the PR. We usually use the ‚ÄúSquash and Merge‚Äù (or rebase) strategy to keep a clean commit history, but not always ‚Äì it depends on the contribution. The PR will be closed automatically when merged. Congratulations, your contribution is now part of EdgeBeat!
- **If changes are requested:** It‚Äôs common for a PR to go through a few iterations. Don‚Äôt be discouraged by a ‚ÄúChanges requested‚Äù review ‚Äì it‚Äôs an opportunity to improve your contribution. Try to address all points raised. If you‚Äôre unsure how to make a requested change, ask for guidance. Maintainers (or other contributors) might even push follow-up commits to your branch in special cases, but usually they‚Äôll let you make the changes so you can learn.
- **Timeline:** We aim to review contributions as promptly as possible, but response times can vary. Simple changes might be reviewed within a couple of days; more complex ones could take longer. If you haven‚Äôt heard anything in, say, a week, feel free to gently ping the thread or maintainer. Sometimes contributions get queued behind other priorities; this isn‚Äôt a reflection on the value of your contribution. We appreciate your patience.
- **After merging:** Your PR being merged is not necessarily the end. If any issues arise from your change (maybe it caused an unexpected bug or regression), maintainers or other contributors might open follow-up issues. It helps to watch for any linked issues or feedback after your code is released, so we can address problems together. Also, feel free to continue contributing ‚Äì one contribution often inspires another!

In summary, code reviews are a collaborative process to uphold high standards and share knowled ([What is a code review? | GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review/#:~:text=,the%20code%20before%20pushing%20changes)) „Äë. By submitting a well-prepared PR and being responsive to feedback, you‚Äôll help the maintainers approve and merge your contribution more quickly. We‚Äôre grateful for your efforts to improve EdgeBeat!

## Branching Strategy

A consistent branching strategy makes it easier for everyone to contribute and for maintainers to manage the project. Here‚Äôs the approach we use for EdgeBeat:

- **Use feature branches for all changes:** Never work directly on the `main` (or primary) branch for your contributions. Instead, create a new branch for each feature addition or bug fix you are working  ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=1,branch%20of%20your%20private%20fork)) „Äë. This isolates your work and makes it simple to create a Pull Request. For example, you might create a branch named `feature/analytics-dashboard` for adding a new dashboard feature, or `bugfix/fix-null-pointer-profile` for fixing a specific bug.
- **One change per branch:** Keep your branches focused on a single topic. Each branch (and its corresponding Pull Request) should address **one** feature or bug (or a set of closely related small changes). Avoid the temptation to do multiple unrelated fixes in the same branch. Focused branches lead to focused PRs, which are easier to review and less likely to introduce unintended side effec ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=1,branch%20of%20your%20private%20fork)) „Äë. If you have multiple contributions, use multiple branches and PRs.
- **Branch off from `main`:** Typically, you should branch from the latest `main` branch (unless the project uses a different development branch, but we‚Äôll assume `main` here). Make sure your local `main` is up-to-date with the upstream repository before creating your branch (use `git pull origin main`). This ensures your new branch starts with the latest code.
- **Avoid committing to main directly:** As mentioned, do **not** commit or push changes directly to the main EdgeBeat repository‚Äôs `main` bran ([Contribution guidelines ‚Äî Acts  documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution/guide.html#:~:text=2,on%20any%20%E2%80%9Cofficial%E2%80%9D%20branch)) „Äë. All changes should go through the PR review process. The only commits on `main` are those that have been reviewed and merged. (Maintainers may make an exception for trivial changes like version bump or urgent hotfixes, but community contributors should always use PRs.)
- **Meaningful branch names:** Name your branches descriptively so that it‚Äôs clear what‚Äôs being done. We prefer a prefix like `feature/` or `fix/` (or `bugfix/`) followed by a short summary. Use hyphens to separate words. Good examples: `feature/user-authentication`, `fix/memory-leak-issue#150`. This makes it easier to identify branches in the repository and in your fork.
- **Keep branches short-lived:** After you‚Äôve opened a PR, and once it‚Äôs merged, you should delete your branch (if using GitHub, you can often click a button to delete it after merge, or set the repository to auto-delete merged branches). Long-lived branches that diverge too much from `main` can become difficult to merge later. If a branch is taking a long time (because a feature is big), consider breaking the work into smaller pieces or periodically syncing with `main` to avoid drifting too far.
- **Sync with `main` regularly:** If your branch is out of date with `main` (you can check this on the PR page where it might say ‚ÄúThis branch is out-of-date‚Äù), update it. Ideally, use `git pull --rebase origin main` on your feature branch to rebase your commits on top of the latest main, or merge main into your branch. Rebasing is cleaner (it keeps history linear), but merging is fine if you‚Äôre not comfortable with rebase. The key is to bring in the latest changes so your work integrates smoothly. Keeping your branch updated prevents tough merge conflicts later and speeds up the merge once approv ([Contributing to Open Source Projects ‚Äî contribution-guide.org  documentation](https://www.contribution-guide.org/#:~:text=,to%20ensure%20a%20speedier%20resolution)) „Äë.
- **Commit best practices:** Commit often, but make sure each commit is self-contained and has a descriptive message. Use the imperative present tense in commit messages (e.g., ‚ÄúAdd X‚Äù, ‚ÄúFix Y bug‚Äù, ‚ÄúUpdate Z docs‚Äù). Avoid commits like ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (work in progress) or half-done code in the final branch that you PR. If you have interim commits that aren‚Äôt meaningful on their own, consider squashing them before merging. Maintainers may ask you to squash commits if there are many trivial ones; alternatively, when using ‚ÄúSquash and Merge‚Äù, the maintainers will combine your commits into one anyway.
- **Rebasing vs. merging for updates:** If you‚Äôre comfortable with git, rebasing your feature branch onto main (instead of merging main into it) can result in a cleaner history. Rebasing essentially moves your commits to follow the tip of main, as if you created the branch from the latest main. This avoids a merge commit in your branch. However, if rebasing is confusing, it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable to do a merge commit from main into your branch to update it. The priority is that your branch is up-to-date and conflict-free; we can always squash commits at merge time. If you do rebase after opening a PR, note that you will need to force-push your branch (`git push -f`) since you rewritten history.
- **Testing in branches:** Feel free to push your branch to your fork (or to a feature branch on the main repo if you have permissions) even before the code is complete, especially if you want to run CI tests or share a preview of your work. Just mark the PR as a ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù if it‚Äôs not ready for full review.
- **Branch naming and issue tracking:** If your branch is intended to fix a specific issue, you can include the issue number in the branch name or commit message (for example, `fix/null-pointer-#123`). This isn‚Äôt strictly required, but it helps connect the branch to the issue. Regardless of branch name, mention ‚ÄúCloses #123‚Äù in your PR description to link the issue.
- **Release branches (for maintainers):** (This is mostly for maintainers) We may occasionally have a `release/x.y` branch if preparing a new version, but contributors generally won‚Äôt need to work with those unless instructed.

By adhering to this branching strategy, you make it easier to manage contributions and ensure that our git history remains organized. This approach (akin to the GitHub Flow model) keeps `main` stable and all work reviewed via PRs, which is important for an open-source project with multiple contributors.

## Community Guidelines

EdgeBeat is committed to fostering an open and welcoming community for all contributors. We expect everyone to follow our **Code of Conduct** and engage in respectful, constructive collaboration. Here are some key points to remember when interacting in the EdgeBeat community (issue discussions, pull request reviews, forums, etc.):

- **Follow the Code of Conduct:** Please read and adhere to the [**EdgeBeat Code of Conduct**](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct, which sets the standards for respectful behavi ([atom/CONTRIBUTING.md at master ¬∑ atom/atom ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs#:~:text=Code%20of%20Conduct)) „Äë. By contributing to EdgeBeat, you agree to uphold this code. Harassment, discrimination, or any kind of inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated. If you witness or experience any conduct that violates these standards, please report it to the maintainers.
- **Be respectful and inclusive:** Treat all fellow contributors with respect. **Be kind** in your communications. Remember that behind each comment or code contribution is a person. Even if you disagree with someone‚Äôs idea or find an issue in code review, critique the idea or code *without attacking the person*. Use welcoming and inclusive language. Everyone was a beginner at some point, and everyone has different contexts and perspectives.
- **Collaborate constructively:** We encourage discussions and appreciate different viewpoints, but keep conversations constructive. Focus on ideas and technical arguments, not on personalities. Offer helpful feedback and be open to receiving feedback yourself. When suggesting changes, explain why. When someone suggests improvements to your contribution, consider them with an open mind ‚Äì the goal is to make EdgeBeat better, not to win an argument.
- **Assume good intentions:** We‚Äôre all here because we want to make EdgeBeat great. If someone does something that puzzles or upsets you, try to assume they meant well and ask for clarification rather than jumping to conclusions. Misunderstandings can happen, especially in text form. Giving others the benefit of the doubt leads to a more positive community.
- **Keep communication clear and relevant:** When opening issues or commenting, make sure your communication is clear and stays on topic. If a discussion in an issue or PR starts diverging into a different topic, consider opening a new issue or discussion thread for that. This helps maintain focus. Avoid spamming or repeatedly pinging people; everyone will respond in due time. 
- **Encourage and support others:** One of the best parts of open source is learning from each other. If someone is new or struggling with an issue you understand, kindly offer guidance. Acknowledge good contributions from others. A simple ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù or ‚ÄúGreat job on this!‚Äù can go a long way to make someone feel welcome. We want contributing to EdgeBeat to be a rewarding experience for everyone.
- **Stay professional:** EdgeBeat might be used by people in professional contexts, and our community is an extension of that environment. While we encourage friendliness, remember to act professionally. This doesn‚Äôt mean being overly formal, but do maintain a level of decorum. Avoid off-color jokes or making comments that you wouldn‚Äôt make in a professional workplace.
- **Reporting issues:** If you encounter a situation that makes you uncomfortable or violates the Code of Conduct, or you see someone else being mistreated, please let the maintainers know. We have designated community moderators and a process (outlined in the Code of Conduct) for handling such reports confidentially. Keeping the community safe and respectful is a top priority.
- **Moderation and enforcement:** Maintainers will enforce the community guidelines and Code of Conduct. This can include editing or removing disrespectful comments, blocking repeat offenders, or in extreme cases, banning individuals from the project spaces. We prefer not to ever need these actions, and by following the guidelines above, we‚Äôll hopefully never have to use them.

We are proud of the friendly and collaborative spirit of the EdgeBeat community. By following these guidelines, you contribute to a positive environment where everyone can share ideas, contribute code, and help each other. EdgeBeat‚Äôs success is tied to its community ‚Äì **let‚Äôs keep it welcoming, supportive, and fun for all**.
