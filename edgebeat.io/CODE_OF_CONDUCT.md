# EdgeBeat Code of Conduct

## Introduction  
EdgeBeat is committed to fostering a friendly, inclusive, and harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, national origin, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=We%20as%20members%2C%20contributors%2C%20and,or%20sexual%20identity%20and%20orientation))  We value diversity and aim to ensure that all participants feel safe and welcome. A clear code of conduct helps us create a positive environment and increases contributors’ psychological safety, empowering maintainers to address issues proactively ([Code of Conduct Toolkit for Open Source Communities - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gomathia/code-of-conduct-toolkit-for-open-source-communities-5hdj#:~:text=A%20code%20of%20conduct%20is,later%20realizing%20one%20was%20needed))  This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior, unacceptable conduct, and the steps for reporting and enforcing our standards. It applies to all community spaces (including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussion forums, and social media) and any situation where someone is representing the EdgeBeat project.

## Standards of Behavior  
All EdgeBeat community members and contributors are expected to uphold a high standard of professionalism, courtesy, and respect toward others ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=As%20contributors%2C%20members%2C%20or%20bystanders,the%20words%20that%20we%20choose))  Behavior that contributes to a positive, constructive environment includes:  

- Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and courtesy toward others  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Accepting responsibility for mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience  
- Focusing on what is best for the community as a whole (over individual gain) ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=,but%20for%20the%20overall%20community)) 
## Unacceptable Behavior  
The following behaviors are **not** tolerated in the EdgeBeat community:  

- **Harassment** – This includes offensive comments, personal insults, or unwelcome attention directed at an individual or group. Harassment can be verbal, physical, or visual, and can involve intimidation, stalking, or continued unwelcome contact. **If someone asks you to stop, you must stop** ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=,It%20is%20not))   
- **Discrimination or Hate Speech** – Derogatory or demeaning remarks, slurs, or jokes targeting someone’s personal characteristics (such as gender, gender identity, race, caste, religion, disability, age, sexual orientation, etc.) are not allowed ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=,or%20sexual%20identity%20and%20orientation))  This also includes violent threats or any encouragement of self-harm or violence against an individual.  
- **Sexual Harassment** – The use of sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention, or advances of any kind is prohibited ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=,or%20advances%20of%20any%20kind))  This community is a professional environment, and any behavior that makes others feel sexually uncomfortable or threatened is unacceptable.  
- **Trolling and Personal Attacks** – Insults, ad hominem attacks, trolling, or other attempts to bait or provoke others are not acceptable ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=,and%20personal%20or%20political%20attacks))  This includes sustained disruption of discussions, “flame wars,” or repeated negative comments intended to derail constructive conversation.  
- **Disruptive or Aggressive Behavior** – Excessive swearing, yelling, or aggressive demands (for example, repeatedly pressuring maintainers for an immediate response or derailing threads off-topic) are not appropriate. Everyone should remain professional and courteous even during disagreements.  
- **Privacy Violations** – Publishing or threatening to publish others’ private information (such as physical or email addresses, real names, or other personal data) without explicit permission is strictly forbidden ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=,be%20considered%20inappropriate%20in%20a))  Respect others’ privacy at all times.  
- **Other Inappropriate Conduct** – Any behavior that a reasonable person would consider hostile, offensive, or inappropriate in a professional environment is unacceptable ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=,inappropriate%20in%20a%20professional%20setting))  This includes advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=,any%20of%20the%20above%20behaviors)) 

## Reporting Guidelines  
If you are subjected to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any concerns, please report it as soon as possible. You can reach out confidentially to the EdgeBeat maintainers at **[EDGEBEAT CoC Committee Email]** (or via direct message to a project maintainer). Include as much detail as you can, such as links, screenshots, or logs if available, to help with the investigation. **All reports will be handled promptly and fairly ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=Instances%20of%20abusive%2C%20harassing%2C%20or,and%20investigated%20promptly%20and%20fairly))  and will be kept private and secure to the fullest extent possible ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=Instances%20of%20abusive%2C%20harassing%2C%20or,be%20kept%20private%20and%20secure)) ** Project maintainers receiving a report are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of the reporter and anyone involved ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=All%20community%20leaders%20are%20obligated,the%20reporter%20of%20any%20incident))   

When reporting, you can expect an acknowledgment of receipt within a reasonable time (e.g. 48 hours). The EdgeBeat team will then review the incident, gather information, and determine an appropriate response. **Reports will be investigated impartially** – if a maintainer or core team member is involved in the incident, they will recuse themselves from handling the report to avoid conflicts of interest. We are committed to a respectful and confidential process for all reports.

## Enforcement Policies  
EdgeBeat community leaders (project maintainers and core team) are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to enforce this Code of Conduct fairly and consistently ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=Enforcement%20Responsibilities))  They have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, commits, issues, and other contributions that violate these standards, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=Community%20leaders%20are%20responsible%20for,inappropriate%2C%20threatening%2C%20offensive%2C%20or%20harmful))  

When a violation of the Code of Conduct is confirmed, the EdgeBeat team will take appropriate action. The exact consequences will be determined by the severity and frequency of the violation, and are intended to be proportionate and corrective rather than punitive whenever possible. Potential enforcement actions include:

1. **Correction (Informal Warning)** – For first-time or minor issues, a private, written warning may be issued to the offender ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=Community%20Impact%3A%20Use%20of%20inappropriate,public%20apology%20may%20be%20requested))  This communication will explain the problematic behavior and why it is unacceptable, gently guiding the person toward more appropriate conduct. The individual is expected to correct the behavior immediately. A sincere apology or other corrective action may be requested if appropriate.  
2. **Official Warning** – For more serious infractions or repeat offenses, an official warning will be given along with consequences for continued misconduct ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=2,a%20temporary%20or%20permanent%20ban))  This may include temporary restrictions, such as a request to refrain from interacting with certain people or topics for a set period. The warning makes it clear that any further violation will result in more serious actions.  
3. **Temporary Ban (Suspension)** – In cases of egregious behavior or repeated violations after warnings, the person may be temporarily banned from the EdgeBeat community spaces ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=3,lead%20to%20a%20permanent%20ban))  During this suspension period, the individual is barred from participating in project repositories, forums, or other channels. They must not attempt to interact with the community in any way until the ban is lifted. Violating the terms of a temporary ban (for example, creating alternate accounts to circumvent the ban) may result in an immediate permanent ban.  
4. **Permanent Ban** – For severe incidents (such as determined harassment, discrimination, or threats) or a repeated pattern of violations with no improvement, a permanent expulsion from the EdgeBeat project and community will be enforced ([Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct#:~:text=4,public%20interaction%20within%20the%20community))  This means the individual will be indefinitely barred from all community spaces and official events. Permanent bans are taken very seriously and implemented only as a last resort, when it is clear that other remediation attempts have failed or when the safety of the community is at risk.

All enforcement decisions will be documented. Community leaders will strive to be consistent and transparent in applying these consequences. In every case, our goal is to address the behavior and restore a safe, respectful environment for the community.  

## Acknowledgment and References  
This Code of Conduct is adapted from established open-source community guidelines, including the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1 ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=This%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20is,covenant.org%2Fversion%2F2%2F1%2Fcode_of_conduct.html))  The Contributor Covenant is a widely adopted code of conduct used by over 40,000 open source projects (including Kubernetes, Rails, and Swift) ([Your Code of Conduct | Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=Wherever%20you%20can%2C%20use%20prior,including%20Kubernetes%2C%20Rails%2C%20and%20Swift))  and it served as a valuable foundation for EdgeBeat’s policies. We also drew inspiration from the community guidelines of other projects, such as the Django Project and the Citizen Code of Conduct ([Your Code of Conduct | Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=The%20Django%20Code%20of%20Conduct,good%20code%20of%20conduct%20examples))  as well as enforcement frameworks like Mozilla’s Code of Conduct enforcement ladder ([CC Open Source Code of Conduct — Creative Commons Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=Community%20Impact%20Guidelines%20were%20inspired,code%20of%20conduct%20enforcement%20ladder)) (which influenced our graduated response to incidents).
