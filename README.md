# EdgeBeat

**EdgeBeat** is a decentralized edge computing platform domain that leverages blockchain and edge technologies to provide scalable compute resources and secure task execution. Built with open-source principles, EdgeBeat Space is part of the larger EdgeBeat ecosystem and is governed by community-driven initiatives.

## Overview

EdgeBeat combines:
- **Decentralized Edge Computing:** Utilize edge nodes to execute compute tasks with high performance and low latency.
- **Blockchain-Powered Security:** Secure task assignments and token-based incentive models through smart contracts.
- **Open-Source Innovation:** Released under the Apache 2.0 license, enabling collaboration and continuous improvement.

## Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Provision cloud resources with Terraform and deploy using Kubernetes manifests.
- **WebAssembly Modules:** Leverage Wasm for high-performance, edge-optimized modules.
- **GitOps Deployment:** Fully automated CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions and ArgoCD.
- **Next-Gen Development Environment:** Integrated with Eclipse Theia for a seamless coding experience.
- **Community Driven:** Comprehensive contribution guidelines, issue templates, and active discussions ensure a vibrant open-source community.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Terraform** for provisioning infrastructure.
- **kubectl** for Kubernetes deployments.
- **Docker** for container builds.
- **Eclipse Theia** or your preferred IDE (configured via `.theia/settings.json`).

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edgebeat/edgebeat.git
   cd edgebeat
   ```
2. **Provision Infrastructure:**
   - Navigate to the `infra/terraform` directory and initialize Terraform:
     ```bash
     cd infra/terraform
     terraform init
     terraform apply
     ```
3. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**
   - Apply
