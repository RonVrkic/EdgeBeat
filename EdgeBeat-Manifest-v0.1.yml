project_overview:
  # Basic project information
  name: EdgeBeat
  platform: Decentralized Edge Computing Platform
  description: >-
    EdgeBeat is an open-source platform that combines edge computing with blockchain technology to 
    create a decentralized network for processing data and workloads at the edge. It enables devices 
    and servers at the edge of the network to contribute computing power and receive tasks, coordinated 
    through secure smart contracts on a blockchain. The project aims to provide a scalable, 
    community-driven solution for distributed computing, where participants can either utilize the 
    network's compute capabilities or contribute their own resources in exchange for incentives.

deployment_models:
  # Deployment models for different user needs
  community: >-
    The community deployment of EdgeBeat is a fully open-source version of the platform that anyone 
    can run. It is designed for developers, hobbyists, and organizations who want to participate in or 
    benefit from the network without a commercial arrangement. Community users can set up EdgeBeat nodes 
    on their own hardware to join the public network, contributing and consuming compute resources. 
    This model emphasizes decentralization and grassroots involvement, with no licensing fees. Users 
    pay only for the actual compute resources they consume (often via the built-in token mechanism), 
    and those payments are distributed to resource providers in the network.
  enterprise: >-
    The enterprise deployment of EdgeBeat offers a commercial-grade version of the platform with 
    additional features, support, and service-level agreements. It is tailored for businesses that 
    require reliable performance, enhanced security integrations, and official support. Enterprise 
    deployments might include a managed SaaS offering or on-premises installations with dedicated 
    enterprise smart contracts for access control and billing. Enterprises can integrate EdgeBeat into 
    their infrastructure to offload workloads to the edge network, while enjoying features like 
    priority compute scheduling, advanced monitoring, and premium support agreements. Licensing for 
    the enterprise model typically involves a subscription or usage-based fees in addition to the 
    underlying resource costs.

licensing:
  # Licensing and open-source aspects
  model: >-
    EdgeBeat is released under a permissive open-source license (Apache 2.0), allowing the 
    community to freely use, modify, and distribute the core platform. This open-source foundation 
    encourages transparency and collaborative improvement of the codebase. The community edition of 
    EdgeBeat is entirely open-source, enabling anyone to inspect the code for security and contribute 
    to its development. For the enterprise edition, while the core remains open, certain premium 
    extensions or tools might be source-available or provided under a commercial license. The project 
    maintains a commitment to open-source principles; even enterprise-focused features are developed 
    in the open when possible, and any proprietary components are kept to a minimum and clearly 
    separated.

technology_stack_and_architecture:
  # Key technologies used and high-level architecture
  stack: 
    - Blockchain: Ethereum (Solidity smart contracts)  # Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum (or compatible chain)
    - Backend: Go, RUST, Python (Edge node software)   # Core EdgeBeat node software implemented in Go for efficiency
    - Frontend: WebAssembly (Web dashboard)            # Web-based dashboard for monitoring (if applicable)
    - Storage: IPFS (for certain data)                 # Uses IPFS or similar for decentralized storage of metadata (if needed)
    - Cloud: Kubernetes, Wasm (optional orchestration) # Optionally uses Kubernetes for orchestrating tasks in enterprise deployments
  architecture: >-
    EdgeBeat follows a distributed architecture comprising on-chain smart contracts and off-chain edge nodes. 
    The smart contracts (on a blockchain network) act as the coordination layer, handling task postings, 
    resource provider commitments, and reward distributions in a trustless manner. Off-chain, independent 
    EdgeBeat nodes (which can be run by community members or organizations) handle the actual computation tasks. 
    When a user submits a job, a smart contract (the compute marketplace contract) records the request. Edge 
    nodes monitor these contracts, pick up tasks that match their capability, perform the computation, and then 
    report results back, with the outcome verified and recorded on-chain. The architecture ensures that no central 
    server is required to broker tasks: the blockchain provides transparency and security, while the edge nodes 
    provide scalability and computing power. This design makes the system resilient and eliminates single points 
    of failure. For enterprise usage, additional layers like a job management API, monitoring dashboard, and 
    permission controls are incorporated, which interface with the same underlying contracts and node software.

smart_contracts:
  # Smart contracts used in the EdgeBeat ecosystem and their functions
  - name: ComputeMarketplaceContract
    function: >-
      Handles the listing and matchmaking of compute tasks. Users submit computation tasks to this contract, 
      specifying requirements and offered compensation. Edge nodes then bid or claim tasks from this contract 
      if they meet the criteria. The contract secures the process by escrowing payments and assigning tasks 
      to nodes in a fair manner (e.g., first-come or auction-based). Once a task is completed and verified, 
      this contract releases the payment to the node that performed the work.
  - name: ResourceTokenContract
    function: >-
      Manages the token economics of the platform. This smart contract issues or tracks a native utility token 
      that represents compute credits within the EdgeBeat network. Resource providers (edge node operators) 
      earn tokens as rewards for contributing compute power, and clients spend tokens to utilize resources. 
      The contract might also handle token minting (through proof-of-work or other consensus) and implement 
      rules for token distribution and supply.
  - name: GovernanceContract
    function: >-
      Enables community governance of the EdgeBeat platform. Token holders or community participants can use 
      this contract to propose and vote on changes to the system, such as protocol upgrades, fee adjustments, 
      or development priorities. The contract executes decisions in a decentralized way, ensuring that major 
      changes require consensus from the community or stakeholders, aligning with the open governance model.
  - name: AccessControlContract
    function: >-
      Provides enterprise-level access management. This contract regulates which entities (addresses) have 
      permission to submit certain classes of tasks or access premium network features. It's used in the 
      enterprise deployment to enforce service agreements. For example, it ensures that only paying enterprise 
      clients can use dedicated high-priority job queues or that specific nodes are reserved for enterprise tasks. 
      In the community network, this might be less utilized, but it becomes crucial for segregating resources in a 
      hybrid community-enterprise environment.

enterprise_fee_model:
  # How the platform generates revenue from enterprise usage
  description: >-
    The EdgeBeat enterprise model introduces a fee structure to ensure sustainability and reward contributors. 
    While community users interact on a pay-per-use basis (compensating resource providers directly via tokens), 
    enterprise clients agree to an additional fee or subscription. This could take the form of a monthly platform 
    subscription for a managed service, or a percentage fee on the compute tasks executed via the network. For 
    instance, an enterprise customer might pay a 5-10% service fee on top of the base compute costs to cover 
    enhanced features and support. These enterprise fees fund the continued development of EdgeBeat and may be 
    partially redistributed to community node operators as bonuses, aligning incentives between the company and 
    the open-source community. The fee model is designed to be transparent, with all transactions (including fees) 
    recorded on-chain for accountability.

        advanced monitoring and analytics tools, and offering SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for enterprise clients. 
        The governance model is further expanded, and community-led improvements are continually merged. In this phase, 
        EdgeBeat seeks to form partnerships with industry players and possibly pursue additional funding to accelerate growth.

announcement_and_community_involvement:
  # Plans for announcing the project and involving the community
  overview: >-
    The unveiling of EdgeBeat is accompanied by a strategic announcement plan aimed at both developers and industry 
    stakeholders. Upon the release of the EdgeBeat Manifest v0.1, the team will publish a detailed 
    blog post and press release introducing the platform's vision and capabilities. Key channels for announcement 
    include technology forums, blockchain and cloud computing communities, and social media (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn). 
    To drive community involvement from day one, the team is launching official communication platforms: a Discord 
    server and a community forum for discussions, feedback, and support. Open-source contributors are encouraged to 
    participate through hackathons and bounties that will be announced in the weeks following the initial launch. 
    By actively engaging with early adopters and developers, EdgeBeat aims to build a vibrant community that helps 
    steer the project.
  community_programs: >-
    Beyond the initial announcement, EdgeBeat is establishing ongoing programs to foster community engagement. 
    This includes a contributor recognition program (with badges or token rewards for significant code contributions), 
    regular community calls or webinars to update on progress, and a roadmap voting mechanism through the governance 
    contract for community-prioritized features. The project will also maintain transparency by publishing meeting 
    notes, development updates, and even financial reports to the community on a regular basis.

funding_and_investments:
  # Information on how the project is funded and plans for investment
  initial_funding: >-
    EdgeBeat's development began with seed funding from its founding team and early angel investors passionate about 
    decentralized computing. This initial capital covered the prototype and testnet phases. The project also received 
    a small grant from an open-source blockchain foundation, recognizing EdgeBeat’s potential to advance edge computing 
    innovation.
  future_plans: >-
    As EdgeBeat grows, the team is exploring additional funding avenues to ensure long-term sustainability. Plans 
    include engaging with venture capital firms for a Series A round to accelerate development, as well as launching 
    a community token sale or grant program to decentralize ownership and involve the user base in funding. Any 
    investment or token distribution will be conducted with transparency and fairness, abiding by regulations and 
    clearly communicating terms to all stakeholders. The funds raised will primarily go towards development, 
    infrastructure, community grants, and security audits, ensuring the platform’s robust growth.

long_term_vision:
  # Long-term vision for the platform as a SaaS and its evolving architecture
  SaaS_and_services: >-
    Looking ahead, EdgeBeat envisions offering a fully-fledged SaaS solution alongside the open network. In this model, 
    organizations can leverage EdgeBeat's capabilities without running their own infrastructure, by subscribing to an 
    EdgeBeat cloud service that seamlessly taps into the decentralized network. This SaaS offering will provide 
    one-click deployment, a user-friendly interface for managing edge tasks, and integration APIs for enterprise 
    software. Over time, value-added services such as data analytics at the edge, machine learning model distribution, 
    and real-time monitoring could be layered on top of the core platform.
  evolving_architecture: >-
    The architecture of EdgeBeat is expected to evolve to incorporate emerging technologies and requirements. This 
    includes exploring interoperability with multiple blockchain networks (or even a custom sidechain) to optimize for 
    speed and cost, implementing layer-2 scaling solutions for handling a high volume of micro-transactions, and 
    leveraging advancements in edge hardware (like more powerful IoT devices) for increased network capacity. The 
    long-term technical vision also considers standardized protocols for edge computing tasks, so that EdgeBeat can 
    integrate or interoperate with other edge and fog computing systems. Ultimately, the goal is for EdgeBeat to 
    become a ubiquitous layer for distributed compute, accessible as easily as cloud services but with the benefits 
    of decentralization and community governance.

compute_resources_and_scaling:
  # How EdgeBeat will manage compute resources and scale the network
  current_state: >-
    At launch, the EdgeBeat network relies on a modest number of volunteer-run nodes contributed by the community and 
    a few strategic partners. Each node registers its capabilities (CPU power, memory, geographic location, etc.) with 
    the network, making it discoverable for tasks. The network can scale horizontally by simply adding more nodes; the 
    smart contracts are designed to accommodate thousands of concurrent nodes and tasks. Initially, tasks may be 
    limited to lower compute intensities or shorter durations as the system is tested.
  scaling_plans: >-
    To handle increasing demand, EdgeBeat's plan is to aggressively scale out the network. This involves community 
    outreach to encourage more individuals and organizations to run EdgeBeat nodes (possibly through incentives like 
    token rewards or subsidized hardware programs), as well as integration with existing cloud/edge providers. For 
    example, partnerships with data center operators or telecom edge services could provide bursts of capacity when 
    needed. The core software will continue to be optimized for performance, and load-balancing strategies will be 
    implemented to distribute tasks efficiently across the network. Automatic scaling features (such as spinning up 
    containerized edge nodes on cloud infrastructure during peak loads) are also being researched as a hybrid approach. 
    The architecture's decentralized nature inherently supports high scalability; as long as there are nodes available, 
    tasks can be subdivided and distributed. Future versions of EdgeBeat will introduce improved scheduling algorithms, 
    support for more complex workloads (like GPU-accelerated tasks), and monitoring tools to ensure the network can 
    handle enterprise-scale computing jobs.

governance_models:
  # Governance structure of the platform, including community compute incentives
  proof_of_work_for_community: >-
    EdgeBeat's governance and consensus incorporate a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism tailored for community-provided 
    compute resources. Unlike traditional PoW purely for mining blocks, EdgeBeat’s PoW serves a dual purpose: securing 
    the network and validating the contributions of compute nodes. Community nodes may be required to perform a 
    lightweight PoW as a Sybil resistance measure: proving their identity and commitment before being eligible to 
    claim tasks. This prevents malicious actors from easily spamming the network with fake nodes. Additionally, the 
    computational effort expended in PoW can be repurposed toward useful work where possible (exploring concepts of 
    “Proof-of-Useful-Work”), aligning the incentive to secure the network with actual computational contributions.
  community_governance: >-
    Governance of EdgeBeat is designed to be transparent and increasingly community-driven. In the early stages, the 
    core team steers most decisions, but with input from the community through discussions and feedback channels. As 
    the platform matures (especially with the introduction of the GovernanceContract), token holders and active 
    contributors will gain the ability to propose and vote on changes. The PoW mechanism for community compute may 
    also feed into governance reputation: nodes that consistently contribute and follow protocol could earn greater 
    voting weight or rewards. The governance model will be documented publicly, and the rules for how decisions are 
    made (and how PoW ties into those decisions) will be transparent to all participants.

community_engagements:
  # Workshops, AMA sessions, and other engagement events planned
  events: >-
    The EdgeBeat team is committed to active engagement with its user base. Regular “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) sessions 
    will be held on platforms like Reddit or Discord, where the founders and developers answer questions and gather 
    feedback. The project also plans to conduct technical workshops and webinars, which will help onboard new users 
    and developers to the platform. These workshops might cover how to set up an EdgeBeat node, how to write client 
    applications to submit tasks, or even how to contribute to the codebase. In addition, EdgeBeat intends to 
    participate in industry conferences and hackathons, either by hosting its own hackathon events focused on 
    edge computing and blockchain, or by sponsoring challenges in larger hackathons to encourage building on the 
    EdgeBeat platform. All upcoming events and recaps of past events will be shared through official communication 
    channels to keep the community informed and involved.

transparency_commitments:
  # Commitment to transparency in operations, development, and governance
  principles: >-
    Transparency is a core principle of EdgeBeat’s project ethos. The team commits to openly sharing information about 
    the platform’s development progress, governance decisions, and financial status. This includes publishing regular 
    progress reports (e.g., monthly development updates), making meeting minutes and important discussions public 
    whenever feasible, and disclosing how funds (from investments or enterprise revenue) are being utilized. All code, 
    including smart contracts and edge node software, is open for community review to ensure there are no hidden 
    functionalities or security issues. Security audits and test results will be released to the community to build 
    trust in the system. As the project evolves, any changes to governance, licensing, or fees will be communicated 
    clearly and well in advance, with an opportunity for community feedback. This transparency not only upholds the 
    trust of users and contributors but also helps in early detection of issues and collective problem-solving.
