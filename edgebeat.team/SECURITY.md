# Security Policy

## Project Stage: Alpha  
EdgeBeat is currently in its **alpha** stage and under active development. We welcome and **actively seek contributions** of all kinds, including those related to security ([Introducing gittuf: A Security Layer for Git Repositories – Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/01/18/introducing-gittuf-a-security-layer-for-git-repositories/#:~:text=gittuf%20recently%20reached%20the%20alpha,as%20updates%20to%20gittuf%E2%80%99s%20design))  During this early phase, we encourage community involvement to improve stability, features, and security. Contributors and users should be aware that the project is in alpha, so there may be rough edges – **testing and feedback (especially on security)** are greatly appreciated.

## Reporting Security Issues  
If you discover a potential security vulnerability in EdgeBeat, please **report it privately**. **Do not file a public issue.** Instead, send an email to **[Security.Issues@edgebeat.info](mailto:Security.Issues@edgebeat.info)** with the relevant details. Include a description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact. The EdgeBeat team will review the report as soon as possible. We ask that you **refrain from disclosing the issue publicly** until we’ve had a chance to investigate and address it.  

We take all security bugs seriously and will acknowledge and thank researchers for responsible disclosure efforts ([.github/SECURITY.md at master · standard/.github · GitHub](https://github.com/standard/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md#:~:text=The%20,effort%20to%20acknowledge%20your%20contributions))  You can expect an initial response to your email within a reasonable timeframe (we aim for within a few days). We’ll keep you informed as we work on a fix and may reach out for additional information if needed.

## Responsible Disclosure  
EdgeBeat does not yet have a formal public disclosure policy or fixed timeline for security fixes (as a large project might have). However, we **strongly support responsible disclosure practices**. This means we ask finders of security issues to report them to us privately first, and give us a reasonable chance to fix the issue **before any public disclosure**. We are a small, growing project, but we will do our best to investigate and patch serious issues as quickly as possible. Once a fix is ready or a mitigation is in place, we will coordinate with the reporter to determine if and when details can be disclosed publicly. *At this alpha stage, we cannot guarantee a specific turnaround time for fixes or public disclosure, but we prioritize security issues and appreciate your patience and cooperation.*  

*(Note: In larger projects, a typical responsible disclosure window might be 60-120 days ([What is a vulnerability disclosure and why is it important? - TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/vulnerability-disclosure#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20vulnerability%20disclosure,with%20researchers%20to%20modify))  While we don’t have a set window yet, we will endeavor to address issues promptly.)*

## Security Best Practices for Contributors  
To maintain a high security standard, we ask all contributors to follow these best practices when developing for EdgeBeat:

- **Secure Coding Practices**: Write code with security in mind. Follow proven guidelines to avoid common vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation to prevent SQL injection or XSS attacks). Adopting and promoting secure coding practices helps minimize flaws in the codebase ([tag-security/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/SSCBPv2.md at main · cncf/tag-security · GitHub](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/SSCBPv2.md#:~:text=,minimize%20vulnerabilities%20in%20the%20codebase))  Always test features for potential security issues and review code for weaknesses before submitting.  
- **Dependency Management & Vulnerability Scanning**: Keep third-party libraries and frameworks up-to-date. Use trusted, well-maintained dependencies and remove unused ones. Regularly **scan for known vulnerabilities** in dependencies and in our code (using tools or services for static analysis and dependency scanning) ([tag-security/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/SSCBPv2.md at main · cncf/tag-security · GitHub](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/SSCBPv2.md#:~:text=containing%20the%20best%20coding%20guidelines,latest%20packages%20or%20implement%20fixes))  Monitoring dependencies and responding to security advisories promptly is crucial to protect against known threats.  
- **Handling of Sensitive Data**: Never hard-code secrets, credentials, or sensitive information in the codebase. **Avoid committing API keys, passwords, or private data** to the repository. Use environment variables or secure configuration files (outside of version control) to manage secrets ([10 GitHub Security Best Practices | Snyk](https://snyk.io/blog/ten-git-hub-security-best-practices/#:~:text=Storing%20credentials%20directly%20in%20GitHub,the%20risk%20of%20inadvertent%20exposure))  If your contribution deals with sensitive data (e.g., user info or keys), ensure it’s properly encrypted or stored securely. Consider using tools like *GitLeaks* or *git-secrets* to detect and prevent committing secrets – these can scan for patterns and block a commit if a secret is found ([10 GitHub Security Best Practices | Snyk](https://snyk.io/blog/ten-git-hub-security-best-practices/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20specialized%20tools%20like%20GitLeaks,in%20Git%20and%20GitHub%20repositories))  Always double-check that you’re not exposing any confidential data in logs or error messages.  
- **API and Authentication Security**: If your contributions involve EdgeBeat’s API or authentication code, ensure that you follow best practices for securing APIs. Always use **secure protocols (HTTPS/TLS)** for any network communication ([Best practices for REST API security: Authentication and authorization - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/10/06/best-practices-for-authentication-and-authorization-for-rest-apis/#:~:text=Always%20use%20TLS))  Implement robust authentication and authorization checks so that only legitimate users or services can access restricted functionality. Use modern, proven authentication frameworks or libraries instead of custom ad-hoc solutions, and enforce practices like **password hashing**, **token expiration**, and rate limiting to mitigate abuse. (For example, using OAuth2/OIDC for user authentication or API keys with proper scopes for service access can greatly enhance security.) Remember that using well-vetted libraries for security functionality is preferred over writing your own from scratch ([Best practices for REST API security: Authentication and authorization - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/10/06/best-practices-for-authentication-and-authorization-for-rest-apis/#:~:text=In%20summary%3A%20use%20good%20libraries))   
- **Supply Chain Security**: Be mindful of the broader software supply chain when contributing. This includes verifying the integrity and authenticity of any external code or dependencies you add. Prefer official sources and check signatures or checksums when available. It’s good practice to **sign commits or tags** for releases to ensure authenticity of code changes ([tag-security/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/SSCBPv2.md at main · cncf/tag-security · GitHub](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/SSCBPv2.md#:~:text=,promote%20secure%20coding%20practices%20within))  We encourage enabling 2FA on your GitHub account and securing your development environment to prevent unauthorized access to the project ([tag-security/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/SSCBPv2.md at main · cncf/tag-security · GitHub](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/SSCBPv2.md#:~:text=,promote%20secure%20coding%20practices%20within))  Additionally, consider generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for significant changes in dependencies, so we maintain transparency about what’s in our software. Being vigilant about supply chain risks (like malicious dependency injection) helps protect EdgeBeat and its users.  

## Bug Bounty  
At this time, **EdgeBeat does not have a bug bounty program**. We are unable to offer financial rewards for reported vulnerabilities. Our project is still young, and while we greatly value and appreciate security contributions, we do not have a bounty system in place. *This may change in the future* as the project and community grow. We intend to re-evaluate the possibility of a bug bounty program over time, especially if we start receiving significant contributions and have the resources to support it. In the meantime, reporters of valid security issues will be **publicly acknowledged** for their help (unless they wish to remain anonymous). Your efforts help make EdgeBeat better and safer for everyone – thank you for understanding and for helping secure our project!
